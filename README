1. Ensure you have apache 2.2.
2. Ensure you have mod_ssl, http-devel 
3. Execute copyfiles.sh. This does not overwrite any existing files. 
4. Copy your web container certificate and key to /etc/certs as hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem.
5. Copy your CA chain-file to /etc/certs as cachain.pem
6. Stop esg-node and backup existing /usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml. Ensure tomcat processes are fully absent.
7. Ensure you don't have httpd running. 
8. Copy the replacement server.xml present in the local usr/local/tomcat/conf directory to /usr/local/tomcat/conf.
9. Ensure that the line below is present in the /etc/pam_pgsql.conf and that it lists your node's fqdn
auth_query=select password from esgf_security.user where username = %u and openid like '%%yournodeFQDNhere%%
10. esg-node start
11. /etc/init.d/esgf-httpd start

Expected behavior:
1. http://yournodename should get auto-redirected to http://yournodename/esgf-web-fe
2. http://yournodename/api/demo should display a flask 'hello world' page
